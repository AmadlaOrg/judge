# Plugin
`judge` that interacts with [hery](https://github.com/AmadlaOrg/hery) that gets the plugin it requires to evaluates.

Since it is impossible to have the logic for all the different entities there is a need for a plugin system. `judge`
supports not only Golang (binary) plugins, but also Bash, Python, JavaScript, etc.
